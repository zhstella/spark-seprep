Before because my Macbook computer system was not the latest version, the version of Podman desktop I downloaded from the website is v4.9.1. 
Even though I tried to upgrade inside the Podman application and use brew to upgrade in the terminal, the latest version I can get is v4.9.4.
So I upgraded my Macbook computer system, deleted the previous downloaded version of Podman desktop, and redownloaded from the website. 
Either I directly downloaded in the website or used brew install podman-desktop in the terminal, the latest version of Podman desktop I could get is still v4.9.4.
Plus it says that podman machine does exist and can not create a new one, but there is no podman machine shown up in the Podman desktop.
